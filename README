Steps to build and run the app

1. git clone
2. Use Gradle 8.0; AGP 8.1.2;
3. build the project in android studio

Assumptions made

- The app was developed in limited amount of time
- The app is still functional and does not crash
- Permission and errors are handled properly
- Architecture needs some improvement

Challenges faced and how they were addressed.

1. Architecture and Camera coupling

There are 3 separate classes to manage Camera business logic
`CameraFragment`; `MainUIHelper`; and `DetectorViewModel`

2. Common renderer for Android Views and PNG

- The app uses `ResultRenderer` to reuse the part of code responsible for rendering results
